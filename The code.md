The data files were provided as xslx files.

The data was found to be fragmented and was difficult to establish linkages between the various files

To get a better picture of the data, we aggregated the data into a more complete Excel file which was more usable.

The querying and reporting interface chosen was Access.

This was chosen for a couple of reasons: The solution had to be portable as it would be demonstrated to other institutions, perhaps in places where internet is not available.

Using access we:
1. Imported the aggregated data tables
2. Built a query
3. Built a form which could interface with the query
